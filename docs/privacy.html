    </section>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Untwist is designed to work entirely on-device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data. Your mood entries, thought records, breathing sessions, and any notes you write never leave your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>Untwist collects minimal data, limited to subscription management:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> Anonymous purchase receipts and subscription status are shared with RevenueCat for subscription validation. No personally identifiable information is included.</li>
        <li><strong>Funnel analytics:</strong> Anonymous milestone timestamps (e.g., "first mood entry recorded") are stored as RevenueCat customer attributes to improve the app experience. These contain no content — only timestamps.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or behavior tracking</li>
        <li>No crash reporting to third parties</li>
        <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No health data shared with HealthKit or any external service</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>On-Device Storage</h2>
      <p>All app data (mood entries, thought records, breathing sessions, settings) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Protected by your device's passcode and encryption</li>
        <li>Included in your device backups (iCloud or local)</li>
        <li>Permanently deleted when you uninstall the app or use "Delete All Data" in Settings</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Untwist uses minimal third-party services, limited to subscription management:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For app distribution, updates, and in-app purchase processing</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management and purchase validation. RevenueCat receives your anonymous App Store transaction data (purchase receipts, subscription status) to manage your subscription. RevenueCat does not receive any of your app content (mood entries, thought records, notes). See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone calls:</strong> If you choose to call an emergency hotline from the crisis screen, your device's phone app handles the call — Untwist does not log or record this action</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Untwist does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, crash reporting tools, or social media trackers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Crisis Detection</h2>
      <p>Untwist includes an on-device keyword detection feature that identifies crisis language in text you type. This processing happens entirely on your device. No text is ever sent to any server. No record of crisis detection events is stored. The feature simply presents emergency contact information when certain keywords are detected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Notifications</h2>
      <p>If you enable daily reminders, notification scheduling is handled entirely by iOS on your device. No push notification server is involved. No notification data is collected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Untwist is rated 12+ and does not knowingly collect any data from children or anyone else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Delete all data at any time via Settings → Delete All Data</li>
        <li>Disable notifications at any time via Settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to permanently remove all data</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If we make changes to this policy, we will update the "Last updated" date. Since we collect no data, changes are unlikely.</p>
