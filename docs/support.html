      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
      <p>All your data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to any server.</p>

      <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
      <p>Go to Settings in the app and tap "Delete All Data". This permanently removes all mood entries, thought records, and breathing sessions. You can also uninstall the app.</p>

      <h3>How do I turn off notifications?</h3>
      <p>Go to Settings in the app and toggle off "Daily Reminder". You can also disable notifications in your device's Settings → Untwist → Notifications.</p>

      <h3>Is Untwist a substitute for therapy?</h3>
      <p>No. Untwist is a self-help tool based on CBT principles. It is not a substitute for professional therapy, diagnosis, or medical advice. If you are in crisis, please contact a mental health professional or call an emergency hotline.</p>

      <h3>What are the emergency hotlines?</h3>
      <p>The app shows emergency hotlines based on your region. You can access these from the heart button on any screen or from Settings → Emergency Contacts. If your region is not recognized, the app directs you to <a href="https://findahelpline.com" target="_blank">findahelpline.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Can I change the app language?</h3>
      <p>Untwist follows your device language. Set your device to English or Turkish in Settings → General → Language & Region.</p>

      <h3>Can I change the theme?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Go to Settings → Theme and choose System, Light, or Dark.</p>
