## Notes for Review
This app is a free self-help tool based on CBT principles. There are no accounts, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases in v1.0. All data is stored on-device using SwiftData. The crisis screen provides direct links to emergency hotlines based on the user's region — these use the standard tel:// URL scheme. If the region is not recognized, the app falls back to findahelpline.com. The app contains a disclaimer on first launch and in settings.
